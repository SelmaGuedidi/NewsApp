* **Room Database Library**:
Room is an Android Jetpack library simplifying database operations. It provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, streamlining database handling with entities, DAOs (Data Access Objects), and a database representation. Room promotes efficient database interactions in Android applications.

* **Retrofit2**: 
Retrofit is a popular HTTP client library for Android, simplifying network requests. It utilizes annotations to define API interfaces, enabling seamless conversion of HTTP calls into Java or Kotlin objects. Retrofit supports various data serialization formats and asynchronous requests, making network communication straightforward.

* **Picasso**:
Picasso is an Android image loading library designed for simplicity and efficiency. It streamlines image loading into ImageView components, handles caching to improve performance, and supports transformations. Picasso simplifies image management in Android applications.
